<h1>Stack Frames and Linkage Conventions</h1>
</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
Two fundamental questions that quickly arise in the implementation of an operating system
are:
<ol type="1">
	<li> what constitutes the state of a computation, and how can that state be
		saved and restored?</li>
	<li> what are the mechanisms by which one software component can request
		services, and receive results from another?</li>
</ol>
We can begin the exploration of these questions by examining subroutine linkage
conventions.
Most students will have already been exposed to this in previous courses (e.g.
computer architecture, programming languages, compiler construction);
This brief review is intended to refresh your understanding of the basic
concepts so that we can build upon them.
</P>
<h2>The Stack Model of Programming Languages</h2>
<P>
Most modern programming languages support procedure-local variables:
<ul>
	<li> They are automatically allocated whenever the procedure (or block) is entered.</li>
	<li> They are only visible to code within that procedure (or block).
	 	They cannot be seen or accessed by code in calling or called procedures.</li>
	<li> Each distinct (e.g. recursive or parallel) invocation of the procedure (or block) has 
	 	its own distinct set of local variables.</li>
	<li> They are automatically deallocated when the procedure (or block) exits/returns.</li>
</ul>
These local variables, as well as parameters and intermediate computational results are most
commonly stored in a Last-In-First-Out stack: with new call frames being pushed onto the 
stack whenever a procedure is called (or a block entered) and old frames being popped off
the stack whenever a procedure returns (or a block is exited).  
Consider the recursive factorial implementation:
<ul>
	<pre><tt>
	int factorial( int value ) {
		if (value <= 1)
			return(value);
		else
			return(value * factorial(value - 1));
	}
</tt></pre>
</ul>
</p>
If I call <tt>factoria(4)</tt>, just before the final invocation
of <tt>factorial</tt> returns, there would be four instances of
<tt>factorial</tt> on the stack, in addition to the call frames
for the code that called <tt>factorial</tt> in the first place.

</p>
<p>
The stack model for 
procedure calls is so universal that most processor architectures provide hardware
instructions for stack management, and depend on the presence of a stack to make
subroutine calls or handle exceptions.  
It should be remembered, however, that the stack model does not work for all
memory allocation needs.  Many data items must last longer than the procedure that
created them.  For example, when read a document into memory, I do not expect
that document to disappear as soon as the read function returns.
Long lived resources should not be allocated on the stack, but rather from the
<em>heap</em> (which we will discuss in a few weeks).
</P>

<h2>Subroutine Linkage Conventions</h2>
<P>
The details of subroutine linkage conventions are highly Instruction Set Architecture
specific, and in some cases language-specific.  
The following examples will be based on the Intel x86 architecture. 
The instructions and registers will be very different for other ISAs, 
but the basic concepts will remain valid.
</p>
<p>
The basic elements of subroutine linkage are:
<ul>
	<li> parameter passing ... marshaling the information that will be passed 
		as parameters to the called routine.</li>
	<li> subroutine call ... save the return address (in the calling routine)
		on the stack, and transfer control to the entry point (of the called routine).</li>
	<li> register saving ... saving the contents of registers that the linkage
		conventions delclare to be <em>non-volatile</em>, so that they can
		be restored when the called routine returne.</li>
	<li> allocating space for the local variables (and perhaps computationsl
		temporaries) in the called routine.</li>
</ul>
When the called routine completes, the process of returning is fairly symmetric:
<ul>
	<li> return value ... placing the return value in the place where the calling routine 
		expects to find it.</li>
	<li>	popping the local storage (for the called routine) off the stack.</li>
	<li> register restoring ...  restore the non-volatile registers to the values they had 
		when the called routine was entered.</li>
	<li> subroutine return ... transfer control to the return address that the
			calling routine saved at the beginning of the call.</li>
</ul>
The corresponding x86 code (for the above <tt>factorial</tt> example illustrates
the register conventions and respective responsibilities of the caller and callee.
The code in <font color="green">green</font> is executed by <em>callees</em>.
The code in <font color="red">red</font> is executed by <em>callers</em>.
</p>
<ul><pre>
_factorial:
</pre><font color="green"><pre>
	pushl	%ebp		// save previous frame pointer
	movl	%esp, %ebp	// top of stack becomes new frame pointer
	pushl	%ebx		// save non-volatile EBX register
</pre></font><pre>
	movl	8(%ebp), %ebx	// copy parameter off stack into EBX
	movl	$1, %eax	// get a constant 1
	cmpl	$1, %ebx	// compare value with 1
	jle	L2		// if less than or equal ...
	leal	-1(%ebx), %eax	// EAX = EBX - 1
</pre><font color="red"><pre>
	subl	$12, %esp	// extend stack for recursive call
	pushl	%eax		// push parameter onto stack
	call	_factorial	// call factorial
	addl	$12, %esp	// clean off the call frame
</pre></font><pre>
	imull	%ebx, %eax	// multiply value by return value
    L2:				// return value is in eax
</pre><font color="green"><pre>
	movl	-4(%ebp), %ebx	// restore saved EBX register
	movl	%ebp, %esp	// restore top of stack
	popl	%ebp		// restore saved frame pointer
	ret			// return to caller
</pre></font>
</ul>
X86 Register Conventions:
<ul>
	<li><tt>%esp</tt> is the hardware-defined stack pointer.</li>
	<li>the X86 stack grows downwards.  A push operation causes
		the top of stack to be the next lower address. A Pop operation
		causes the top of stack to be the next higher address.
	<li><tt>%ebp</tt> is typically used as a frame pointer ... it points at the
		start of the current stack frame (where the top of stack was
		at the time of entry).</li>
	<li><tt>%eax</tt> is a volatile register that is expected to contain the
		return value when the called routine returns.</li>
	<li>parameters are pushed onto the stack immediately before
		the caller's return address.</li>
	<li>the <tt>call</tt> instruction pushes the address of the
		next instruction onto the stack, and then transfers
		control to the next location.</li>
	<li>the <tt>ret</tt> instruction pops the return address off of the
		top of the stack and transfers back to that location.</li>
	</ul>

While these details can be ISA specific, we also observe that:
<ul>
	<li>Register saving is the responsibility of the called routine.
		This is often done, because only the called routine knows
		which registers it will use (and therefore which it needs
		to save and restore.</li>
	<li>Cleaning parameters off of the stack is the responsibility
		of the calling routines.  This is often done, because only
		the calling routine knows how many parameters is actually
		passed.</li>
	<li>The clear deliniation of responsibilities between the 
		caller and callee make it possible to have proceedures
		written in one language (e.g. C) called by programs 
		written in another language (e.g. FORTRAN).</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is little point in memorizing the detailed linkage conventions
of an obsolete Instruction Set Architecture.
There is still, however, value in understanding each step of the above process,
because the same basic steps (some, perhaps automated by hardware)
can be seen in almost all linkage conventions.   After you have 
understood one set of linkage conventions, you should have little
trouble understanding outhers.
</p>
<p>
It is also interesting to note how relatively simple it is to
save and restore the state of a procedure;  It is merely a stack
frame and a few registers ... most of whose values are stored in
the next stack frame.
</p>
<h2>Traps and Interrupts</h2>
<P>
Most Instruction Set Architectures include support for interrupts 
(to inform the software than an external event has happened) and 
traps (to inform the software of an execution fault).  These are
similar to procedure calls in that:
<UL>
	<LI> we want to transfer control to an interrupt or trap handler.</li>
	<LI> we need to save the state of the running computation before doing so.</li>
	<LI> after the event has been handled, we want to restore the saved state
		and resume the interrupted computation.</li>
</UL>
The key differences between a procedure call and an interrupt/trap are:
<UL>
	<LI> a procedure call is requested by the running software, and the
		calling software expects that, upon return, some function will
		have been performed, and an approprate value returned.</li>
	<LI> because a procedure call is initiated by software, all
		of the linkage conventions are under software control. 
		Because interrupts and traps are initiated by the hardware,
		the linkage conventions are strictly defined by the hardware.
	<LI> the running software was not expecting a trap or interrupt,
		and after the event is handled, the computer state should
		be restored as if the trap/interrupt had never happened.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
A typical interrupt or trap mechanisnm works as follows:
<UL>
   <LI> there is a number (0, 1, 2 ...) associated with every possible
	external interrupt or execution exception.</li>
   <LI> there is a table, initialized by the OS software, that associates
	a Program Counter and Processor Status word (PC/PS pair) with 
	each possible external interrupt or execution exception.</li>
   <LI> when an event happens that would trigger an interrupt or trap:
	<OL type="1">
	   <li> the CPU uses the associated interrupt/trap number to index
		into the appropriate interrupt/trap vector table.</li>
	   <li> the CPU loads a new program counter and processor status word
		from the appropriate interrupt/trap vector.</li>
	   <li> the CPU pushes the program counter and processor status word
		associated with the interrupted computation onto
		the CPU stack (associated with the new processor status word).</li>
	   <li> execution continues at the address specified by the new
		program counter.</li>
	   <li> the selected code (usually written in assembler, and called a <em>first level handler</em>:
		<ul>
		   <li>saves all of the general registers on the stack</li>
		   <li>gathers information from the hardware on the cause of the interrupt/trap</li>
		   <li>chooses the appropriate second level handler</li>
		   <li>makes a normal procedure call to the second level handler,
		       which actually deals with the interrupt or exception.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
   <LI> after the second level handler has dealt with the event, it returns
	to the first level handler, after which ...
	<OL type="1">
	   <li> the 1st level handler restores all of the saved registers (from the interrupted computation).</li>
	   <li> the 1st level handler executes a privileged <tt>return from interrupt</tt> or <tt>return from trap</tt>
		instruction.</li>
	   <li> the CPU re-loads the program counter and processor status word from the
		values saved at the time of interrupt/trap.</li>
	   <li> execution resumes at the point of interruption.</li>
	</ol>
   </li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="trap_ctl.gif" alt="TRAP vectoring and return"/><br>
<strong>Flow-of-control associated with a (system call) trap</strong>
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="trap_stack.gif" alt="STACK during trap handling"/><br>
<strong>Stacking and un-stacking of a (system call) trap</strong>
</P>
<P>
This interrupt/trap mechanism:
<ul>
   <li> does a more complete job of saving and restoring the state of the interrupted computation.</li>
   <li> translates the (much simpler) hardware-driven call to the 1st level handler into a normal
        higher-level-language procedure call to the chosen 2nd level hander.</li>
</ul>
The similarities might make it seem that an interrupt/trap is only a little bit more expensive than
a procedure call (more registers to save, plus the added computation to decide what 2nd level handler
to call.  But this ignores the fact that an interrupt/trap causes a new processor status word to
be loaded into the CPU ... which will probably move us to a new (likely more privileged) processor mode, 
running in a new (unrelated to the interrupted program) address space, and almost surely
involve a complete loss of the CPU caches.  And the same things will happen again upon return.
Consequently, taking an interrupt or trap is likely to be somewhere between 100x and 1000x as 
expensive as making a procedure call.
</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>
Procedure and trap/interrupt linkage instructions provide us with:
<UL>
   <li>	a preliminary low level definition of <em>the state of a computation</em> and 
    	what it means to <em>save</em> and <em>restore</em> that state.</li>
   <li> an introduction to the basic CPU-supported mechanisms for synchronous and 
   	and asynchronous transfers of control.</li>
   <li> an initial example of how it might be possible to interrupt an on-going
        computation, do other things, and then return to the interrupted computation
	as if it had never been interrupted.</li>
</ul>
In the following chapters we will build on these foundations to implement
processes and system calls.
